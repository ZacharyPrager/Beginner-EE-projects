Welcome to my collection of beginner Electrical Engineering (EE) projects! This repository documents my learning journey through hands-on projects as I explore the fundamentals of circuits, components, embedded systems, and signal processing.

## ðŸ“š About

This repo is a work-in-progress archive of simple and foundational EE projects. Whether it's using breadboards, microcontrollers like Arduino, or basic analog components, each project is built with learning and experimentation in mind.

These projects were created as I pursued my Electrical Engineering degree and are meant to:
- Reinforce theory through practice
- Develop hands-on circuit-building skills
- Explore the use of sensors, motors, and embedded systems
- Document progress from basic to more advanced topics
