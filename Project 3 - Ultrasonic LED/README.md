# What I learned: 

I learned how the HC-SR04 sensor worked and its honestly very simple. 

  The TRIG pin sends out an ultrasonic wave (traveling at the speed of sound), that refelcts. 
  The ECHO pin will switch to LOW when the TRIG's signal comes back. Thus, the arduino looks at ECHO as an input pin.
